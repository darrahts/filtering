Kalman Filter Examples
I have posted several Kalman filter example documents.  Read them and consider 
the following things:

1. What if the initial state estimate is bad?  In this situation the particle
filter has an advantage, due to a large number of particles being tracked.

2. Look at examples that try different models for the same problem.  
Choosing the model of the system can be critically important.

3. The GPS/IMU paper looks at a way to detect bad data.  I'm not necessarily
endorsing their approach, but the idea of evaluating the quality of the
measured data can be a good idea.  Think about it.
